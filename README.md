situation, whereas most of the other times it is a planned checkup/visit. But in both
cases we have to visit the doctor to make an appointment or wait in long queues.

medical scene have decided to come up with a WEBSITE, which will host the medical
services available in different cities. Individuals will be able to search for specialist
doctors in their surroundings and even book online appointments.

Patients.
